# CS441_Google_Calendar_API

The goal of this project was to create a simple app that integrated with a user's Google Calendar to allow them to add new events and see their upcoming events.
I did not achieve that goal, mostly due to poor documentation for using Google's API with Android. I've used Google's API for Calendar with javascript before without much resistance so I figured that this wouldn't be an unreasonable undertaking.
Instead, I spent over a week toiling away trying to get connected to Google's API just so I could read a Google Calendar. I checked so many different tutorials and articles and references in documentation and even trying code from Google's own samples for using their libraries with android, all of which were very different procedures and none of them yielding the desired results.
Unfortunately, because of that this app has no functionality and on face value just looks like an empty app that allows you to switch between 3 screens.
I did my best, Google won.

## Production Log:

Dec 12, 2019: Final attempts at using Google's API on a google technology, no luck. Google beat me this time!!

Dec 11, 2019: Resetting project to clear out possible leftover code from failed attempts that may have gotten in the way of new attempts. This made no difference.

Dec 10, 2019: Trying to use an online tutorial to use the Google Calendar API

Dec 9, 2019: Trying to get it going with a Google Android quickstart which then says everything after that point should follow the Java quickstart. Spoiler: it didn't

Dec 1-8, 2019: Trying starting up Google API with Java quickstart
